      data-body="if i could map out every safe place i’ve ever known, they’d all lead back to you. your voice, your hands, the way you say my name like it belongs somewhere soft. i didn’t think love is supposed to feel like this but i’m so glad it does with you.">

      data-body="there’s a kind of peace in knowing i get to choose you again tomorrow. and the day after that. and every ordinary day that follows. loving you isn’t a single moment — it’s a habit, a commitment, my heart picked up and never wants to break.">

      data-body="if i had to explain what loving you feels like, i’d say it’s like finding the place you were meant to return to all along. not a destination, not an ending — just a home i didn’t know i was searching for until i found you.">

      data-body="i didn’t plan for you. you weren’t something i searched for or tried to find. and yet somehow, everything in my life bent just enough for our paths to meet. sometimes i think the world nudged us together quietly, like it knew something we didn’t yet.">

      data-paper="stationery20.png"

      data-paper="stationery21.png"
      data-body="i tried to keep it small at first. tried to pretend it was just fondness, just passing affection. but you have a way of drawing honesty out of me without trying. loving you feels less like a choice and more like something my heart admitted before i even understood it.">

      data-paper="stationery22.png"
      data-body="when i think about the future, everything else fades a little. not in a scary way — in a peaceful way. like the world simplified itself down to what matters most. and somehow, you stand at the centre of it all, steady and bright.">

      data-title="08/03/2026"
      data-paper="stationery23.png"
      data-body="i don’t know what you did to me. nothing dramatic, nothing sudden — just small moments, quiet words, the way you exist. and now i find myself softer, braver, happier, all because you happened to walk into my life.">

    <button class="letter-card"
      data-title="09/03/2026"
      data-paper="stationery24.png"
      data-body="i don’t know if fate is real. but sometimes i think about all the small coincidences that led to you, and it’s hard not to wonder. maybe love isn’t about searching — maybe it’s about recognising the person who was always meant to feel familiar.">

      data-paper="stationery26.png"
      data-body="there’s something about having you close that quiets the noise in me. like the world fades out and all that’s left is the steady reminder that you’re here. i didn’t know comfort could feel this physical, this real, this simple yet complex.">

      data-paper="stationery27.png"
      data-body="you came into my life so quietly that i didn’t realise how much space you were taking up until you were already everywhere. there was no single moment where everything changed — just small conversations, small laughs, small pieces of you settling into my days. and somehow, before i knew it, you weren’t just part of my life anymore. you were the warmth in it, the softness in it, the place my thoughts kept returning to without asking permission.">

      data-body="i know life isn’t always gentle. i know there will be days where things feel distant, where words don’t come easy, where the world presses in on us both. but i don’t want a love that only exists when everything feels warm. i want the kind that survives the cold, the kind that pulls closer instead of drifting apart. if winter ever comes for us, i want to be the hands you reach for without thinking.">

      data-body="i don’t want to love you cautiously, like i’m afraid of what might happen. i want to love you fully, honestly, while i have the chance to. not because i think love needs grand gestures, but because you deserve something more — something offered freely, without hesitation, while i’m here to give it.">

      data-body="i don’t think love has to be dramatic to feel magical. sometimes it’s just the way you sit beside me, or how our conversations drift into the night without effort. nothing about us feels staged or rehearsed — and maybe that’s what makes it special.">

    </button>

    <button class="letter-card"
      data-title="15/03/2026"
      data-paper="stationery30.png"
      data-body="you have this way of softening the rough parts of me without asking me to change who i am. you don’t try to fix me or reshape me — you just see me, and somehow that makes me want to grow on my own. loving you doesn’t feel like being judged. it feels like being understood.">

      data-body="there are moments when i look at you and i wish i could freeze time just for a second. not because of how you look, but because of how you feel to me in that moment — familiar, grounding, almost unreal in the best way. i don’t think any picture or memory could ever fully hold what you feel like to me when you’re right there.">
