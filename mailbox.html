      data-body="there’s a kind of peace in knowing i get to choose you again tomorrow. and the day after that. and every ordinary day that follows. loving you isn’t a single moment — it’s a habit, a commitment, my heart picked up and never wants to break.">

      data-body="if i had to explain what loving you feels like, i’d say it’s like finding the place you were meant to return to all along. not a destination, not an ending — just a home i didn’t know i was searching for until i found you.">
